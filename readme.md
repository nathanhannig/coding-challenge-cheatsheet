# Coding Challenge Cheatsheet

## About
While grinding code challenges would help remember solutions, I felt these sites and courses lacked:
- Plain explanations for a quick historical reference
- Identifying the repeatable patterns that can be applied across questions

This is my attempt to document some of the most common challenges in order to see the similarties.
